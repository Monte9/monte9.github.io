**So the other night, I decided to attend Design Night at the Autodesk Gallery (@1 Market Street) and I couldn’t have asked for a better introduction into the “World of Tech” (WoT pronounced like “what”)**

A lot of you might be familiar with AutoDesk as the company that is a leader in developing software for the architecture, engineering and entertainment industries along with a few others. The company organizes Design Night events the first Thursday of every month to celebrate the creative process and show how people are using new technology to imagine, design, and create a better world. The gallery features over 20 exhibits, including original works by Lego, Mercedes-Benz, Nike, Sony Pictures, and more.

Anyways, I happened to attend one of the Design Nights with the theme of Energy Hacking. Sounds cool right? That’s the only reason I ended up attending. I didn’t have friends to go with, neither did I know what to expect at the event. None the less, I went and I had a great time. The guest speaker was Saul Griffith, founder of Otherlab, speaking about design that’s great for the environment. There was free food + open bar and a lot of interesting people to network with. I ended up connecting with a few people and got a feel for what it is like to work in the Tech capital of the world, San Francisco.

Oh and btw, they had a workshop where you could build your own Solar powered fan and I thought that was too much fun to miss. So I ended up building one too. Yay DIY!!

Since this is one of my first blog post and I am sure not the last, I am going to end it with a few pictures so that you can get a glimpse of what the night was like.
