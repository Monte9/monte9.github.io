**The original DeLorean from the movie was brought on premises towards the end of the event and it felt pretty surreal to sit inside it as I imagined Marty McFly sitting in the exact same seat 30 years ago. #ANightToRemember**

I attended Twitter’s annual development conference (called Twitter Flight) at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on October 21, 2015 (wait.. isn’t that BACK TO THE FUTURE DAY?!) Yes it is, and for this occasion Twitter made sure the attendees had ‘a night to remember’. The original DeLorean from the movie was brought on premises towards the end of the event and it felt pretty surreal to sit inside it as I imagined Marty McFly sitting in the exact same seat 30 years ago. #ANightToRemember

Just like all other tech-events that I attend, I live-tweeted from the event. Using a social megaphone which is Twitter, I was able to bring a quasi-virtual experience from inside the event to my huge following on Twitter (that’s 411 people). I usually blog about these events once they are done and put up a few pictures as well although for this blog post I am going to try something different.

Since it was a Twitter event, I am going to present this blog post as a series of tweets in chronological order. So here goes…

*Tweets coming soon*
