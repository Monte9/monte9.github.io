If your goal is to showcase your work, development skills and breadth, I'd recommend combining 'iOS portfolio' and 'hackathons' into a 'projects' section, specify the platform in the description, and be sure to have a .gif example of the implementation, and a bulleted list of the technical accomplishments / features for each.

could you refer me to anyone that you think would value my passion for iOS development and my interest in working with smart people to solve challenging problems using technology.

Putting your app in the App Store and getting people to use it, is one thing you can do to improve your portfolio.

**Curated list of all my technical projects so far.**
